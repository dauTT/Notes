# If you have synaptic installed on your system, here is what should work.
# Launch synaptic (you will probably be prompted for your password)
# Click on Search and search for brave - you should find brave-browser
# Click on the brave-browser entry
# On the menu select Package and then Force versionâ€¦
# From the dialog presented you can pick from the available versions. 1.0.1 should be listed
# Click on Force Version which will close the dialog.
# On the menu click Apply, answer Apply on the dialog which comes up and the old package will be downloaded and installed in place of the defective version
# Finally select the brave-browser line in the list, Click Package on the menu and select Lock version. That will hold brave at 1.0.1 until you uncheck Lock version.
# Those are the steps in synaptic on Linux Mint. The steps should be the same on Kubuntu.
# Let us know if that works.


# If you do not have synaptic you can install it from a command line (terminal)
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install synaptic

```
